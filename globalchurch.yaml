        This is the stable, system-issued identifier for a user.
        It is used as the primary key and as the target of foreign keys in related tables.
        Must be a valid UUID (v4 recommended). Never reuse or recycle a user_id.
    examples:
      - value: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

        Store the surname only. Do not include suffixes (e.g., Jr., III) or prefixes (e.g., Dr.).
        If the person has a single name, leave this blank and use given_name only.
    examples:

        Must satisfy the `email` scalar pattern (simplified RFC 5322).
        Use the address the user prefers for platform communication.
        For church emails discovered via scraping, use `scraped_email` on EnrichedData instead.
    examples:
      - value: "trent@example.org"

        Store numbers in E.164 format (e.g., +14155552671). Country code is required.
        Do not include spaces, parentheses, or dashes. For church phone, use `phone` slot.
    examples:
      - value: "+13105551234"

        Points to `Church.church_id`. Use when a user affiliates with a single congregation.
        If the user participates at multiple churches, consider also setting `alternate_church`.
    examples:

        This is the official mailing or street address, suitable for postal delivery and mapping.
        Always include street number, street name, and any suite or apartment details if applicable.
        Follow the local postal format for the country (e.g., street before city in the US).
        Avoid using P.O. boxes unless it is the only available mailing address for the entity.
        For international addresses, include all relevant locality and region information.
        Use this slot for the canonical address, not for addresses scraped from websites (see `scraped_address`).
    examples:
      - value: "123 Main St, Springfield, IL 62704"

        Use the official or most commonly recognized municipality name.
        This value should match the locality as used by local postal authorities.
        For rural areas without a city, use the nearest recognized locality.

        The primary administrative subdivision for the locality, such as state (US), province (Canada), or region (EU).

        (e.g., “Plan a Visit”, “Give”, “Watch Live”). Useful for enrichment heuristics.

        Use for lightweight integrity checks (e.g., a hash of the DOM or a status string
        like “ok”, “blocked”, “timeout”). Helps detect page changes between scrapes.

        Potential internal links to pages like “Beliefs”, “Ministries”, “Visit”, etc.
        Feed these into downstream enrichment for targeted scraping.
        Store fully qualified URLs when possible.
    examples:

        Use a consistent representation (e.g., JSON strings) pairing anchor text with href.
        Example object shape: {"text": "Beliefs", "url": "https://…/beliefs"}.
        Helps prioritize which candidate links are most relevant.
    examples:
      - value: "[\"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"Beliefs\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://gracechurch.org/beliefs\\\"}\", \"{\\\"text\\\": \\\"Plan a Visit\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://gracechurch.org/visit\\\"}\"]"

        Free text or structured patterns (e.g., “Sun 9:00 & 11:00; Wed 19:00”).
        If multiple campuses or languages differ, note this in `service_languages` and
        `programs_offered` where appropriate.
    examples:

        Prefer the canonical “Beliefs” page for doctrinal summaries.

        Use the controlled values in BeliefTypeEnum. When unclear, set `unknown`.

        Use when the canonical `address` is not available or differs from the site.
        This value may be noisy and should be normalized or validated before publishing.
